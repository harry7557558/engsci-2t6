Labs I did for the ESC103 Engineering Mathematics and Computation course during tutorials. I think it is suitable to post them here because I added my primary thoughts and experimentations, which are not something you can often see on marked assignments.

You need MATLAB to view and run `.mlx` files. I also exported HTML for convenience.
